# DodgyPass
DodgyPass is a golden collection of weak passwords.

Currently, only "dodgypass.txt" is available. It is suitable for brute-forcing Active Directory passwords and other online authentications with potentially strong password policies. The repository's content may be updated in the future to improve the wordlist and add additional ones.

The purpose of this repository is to help conducting penetration tests on authorized hosts. Otherwise, the repository may be used for educational purposes only.
